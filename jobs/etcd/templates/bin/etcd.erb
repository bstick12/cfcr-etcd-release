# When `spec.bootstrap` is true and there is no existing etcd member directory,
# we can assume that we are the first node starting in a new cluster. In this case
# we will bootstrap a single node cluster with the current node as the only member.
#
# When `spec.bootstrap` is true and there is an existing etcd member directory, we
# can assume that the cluster is already present, and start the etcd node normally.
#
# When `spec.bootstrap` is false and there is no existing etcd member directory,
# we can assume that we are a new node in an existing cluster. In this case we can
# add the current node as a member, and start the cluster with the `ETCD_INITIAL_CLUSTER`
# flag that is returned in the output.
